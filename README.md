## Description
Prompt is to generate a 16x16 grid of squares that the user will be able to change the color of by mousing over. I thought that it would be more useful if the program also required the mouse be 'clicked' so that the user could make pictures more cleanly. 

The program should have two functional buttons - erase and change grid size. I implemented both of these buttons in a modular fashion, keeping the design simple such that each function only does 'one' thing.

## Extra-Credit 
Rather than a simple color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the squareâ€™s RGB value entirely.
